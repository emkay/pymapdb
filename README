A simple MySQL DB mapping application. Feed it a MySQL InnoDB database and it will produce a graph and/or Graphviz code.

This application depends on graphviz being installed as well as pygraphviz and MySQLdb. 

To install everything you need to get up and running on Debian installations run:
	
	sudo apt-get install graphviz python-pygraphviz python-mysqldb

If you need further instructions pygraphviz can be found at http://networkx.lanl.gov/pygraphviz/download.html and Graphviz at http://www.graphviz.org/.

The node shape option defaults to box, but can take any shapes listed here: http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html.
